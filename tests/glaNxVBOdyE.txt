oh the teachers in the

classes
the fifth graders these days have to choose
a second foreign language which is
German  not very
popular is considered elitist and complicated
and is only chosen by 15% of the
students nationwide the two countries had once
agreed with the elisee contract
to improve understanding for odinos
and prey the anniversary is the reason for the
grievance of speechlessness
there
is nothing to draw attention to and I benefit from it. It is
a political task because
on the one hand it is difficult to celebrate and
on the other hand Germanists know more
about France, so I think
there are still Germans who are learning French,
but there is a risk
that we will  one day almost no
Germanist in France  have and we
absolutely want to prevent that is
already feeling the consequences on the way
to the next college he has to teach at several
schools to get his
lessons and is therefore not an
isolated case in France there is an acute lack of
German teachers during the break
we will accompany you to his city why
is  one of the first to organize
a Franco-German
student exchange in the early 1960s hello,
how are you,
the United States of Europe, they
are on the right track,
the newscaster commented euphorically at the time,
there were already wars between
us
bloody wars, but we are proof we
could maybe be archenemies  be and
be best friends that means everyone
in the world can also look at us
and see that enemies can now become best
friends
two statesmen were
in the arms of Adenauer and de Gaulle 60 years ago
they promised each other
a common line on important political issues
to  find agreed

] long live Germany long live the through
French friendship a commitment
to one another that recently failed to materialize a
state visit by olaf scholz in elisee
last fall a long list of
disagreements caused the two
times of crisis, which irritated public silence, in which
europe should stand together  explains the
historian Josephte Weg, who is
at home in both languages, in this
respect it is good that there is this important
anniversary because it forces one
to think again it is clear
that the European Union now has 27
Member States and it has not been the case for a long time
that Germany and
France alone can determine the course of the
eu ship, but if
these two countries row in a different
direction or not at all at the
same time brother and then the
ship will not move at all, especially
since the
Ukraine war  its and energy Questions
about joint action
but the two apparently found it
difficult to coordinate in the past few months there
were many solo appearances in his
big
Europe speech in Prague by Olaf Scholz,
the Chancellor did not mention the
Franco-German partnership at
all and  for the
French, reconciliation with
Germany is the real reconciliation of
the European Union that was an
affron and so there was also the
tit for tat from Paris we think of
the canceled Council of Ministers e.g. where Macron
Scholz publicly let the
German-French image damage
such appearances we hear  also at the
crisis meeting of the German
teachers in Paris whose association is now increasing
the pressure on politicians demands more
lessons and a language offer
at all schools in France
there are very rational arguments for
German it is an important language on
the job market and of course for
Europe if we always
compare  between the German
students learning the French language
and the Germans the
French students learning the German
language then we notice that
we have far fewer hours than the
Germans is not as present as
English or Spanish in the music on
a
television
Spanish is very big in the series and that's complicated for
German because we have
to fight against

you can't teacher sompei has been doing this
with hip-hop workshops in his class
has been tested for weeks and composes
in  May they compete against more than a thousand
schoolchildren from
both countries in a competition initiated by
the German-French band
that can stand for one or three
people and toi toi toi in German
means as much as good luck and we wish
the three of them that  People in our song want to push
the boundaries
we need to formulate sentences
look up words when  we text in German
the
older students have already told us about the
project that sounds great
also that we will then be on stage
one has to get the students
interested in the language via detours
inspire enthusiasm for the language says zum Bree in
