<p style="font-size:120%">In a YouTube video, Jeffrey van Gogh interviews Steve McConnell, author of &#34;Code Complete,&#34; to discuss the evolution of programming languages, the importance of readable and maintainable code, and exposure to different programming languages in modern development. They stress the importance of finding team members skilled in compilers, the impact of open source, and the need for soft skills in managerial roles. McConnell recommends new programmers gain experience through quantity and reading others&#39; code, and reflects on the research process that went into writing his book on software construction.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">Jeffrey van Gogh, a director of engineering at Google, interviews Steve McConnell, the author of the &#34;Code Complete&#34; book. They discuss the evolution of programming languages, the impact of agile programming, the importance of readable and maintainable code, and exposure to multiple programming languages in today&#39;s full-stack development. McConnell emphasizes the importance of making code self-documenting and readable for other humans, and how tooling and IDEs have helped developers comprehend code better.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">The speaker discusses hiring for a team that specializes in compilers and programming languages, emphasizing the importance of finding individuals with skills in compilers rather than just one language. They discuss the usefulness of open source in exposing students to real-world architecture and the potential risks of supply chain security when taking dependencies on third-party code. The speaker also discusses their pet peeve regarding the use of &#34;i&#34; as an index in loops and the missed opportunity for documentation.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">The video discusses the use of the variable &#34;i&#34; in programming and suggests that using more descriptive variable names can improve readability for the reader of the code. The conversation then touches on personal coding projects during the COVID pandemic, including the use of Excel, VBA, and Wordpress. The topic shifts to managerial roles in software construction, with the guest suggesting that managers who write production code can put the project schedule at risk and may harm team morale if not done correctly. The guest emphasizes the importance of soft skills for managers and mentions conducting a leadership exercise on the subject. The conversation concludes with a discussion of the extensive research that went into writing the guest&#39;s book on software construction.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">The speaker talks about how he wrote his book &#34;Code Complete&#34; through researching 600 articles and books, serving as a filter for research and incorporating peer review. He also advises new programmers to gain experience through quantity and reading other people&#39;s code, and reflects on how different audiences have different levels of readiness to learn about good software practices. Additionally, there is discussion about the value of case studies and the differences between university students&#39; and practicing professionals&#39; perceptions of how the real world works.</p>
